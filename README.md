# Version Control for Audio Projects

This is a simple demonstration of how git can be used to keep track of audio projects. 

This approach would be most suited to:
* Audio programming projects where files are plain text.
* MIDI based projects or things like Max / Reaktor where file sizes are relatively small. 
* Projects with larger audio files which are unlikely to change.

This probably wouldn't be so good for:
* Projects with really large audio files that:
    -  Are likely to be destructively edited in place.
    -  Involve tracking lots of audio.
